## Follow-up

Unfortunately, thereâ€™s one step you have to do manually via the command-line
before you can use your Sentry installation. First, ensure you have the
[Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed, and then run the following:

```sh
heroku run --app YOURAPPNAME sentry --config=sentry.conf.py createsuperuser
```

Enter a username, email address, and password for your first user account.
